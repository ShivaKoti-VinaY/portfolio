        <h3>Tic tac toe game</h3>
        <p>
          To solve games using AI, we will introduce the concept of a game tree followed by minimax algorithm. The different states of the game are represented by nodes in the game tree, very similar to the above planning problems. The idea is just slightly different. In the game tree, the nodes are arranged in levels that correspond to each player's turns in the game so that the ‚Äúroot‚Äù node of the tree
